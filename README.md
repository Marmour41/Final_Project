# Final_Project

## Selected Topic
- Analyzing motor vehicle accident data in the City of Austin.

## Reason for Selecting Topic
- We want to build a model that will predict the severity of crash depending on different factors. 
- A person could use this to see how severe an injury they would incur based on different cars, different weather scenarios, etc. 

## Description of the Source Data
- TxDot Crash Query System
- In depth data on thousands of crashes over multiple years.

## Questions we hope to answer with the data
- What type of cars are involved in more accidents in Austin?
- What highways, weather conditions, age, gender, and a variety of other factors have on accident outcomes.
